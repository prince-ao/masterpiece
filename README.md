## :runner: Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>

Our motivation behind developing this software app was to create a fair art market that addresses the challenges faced by both sellers and buyers in determining the value and pricing of art pieces. We recognized that the traditional art market can be opaque and subjective, making it difficult for artists and art enthusiasts to navigate and establish fair transactions. With the power of AI, we aim to revolutionize the art market by leveraging advanced algorithms and data-driven insights. Our goal is to provide a platform that fosters transparency, trust, and fairness for all stakeholders involved in the art ecosystem.
