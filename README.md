## :round_pushpin: Overview <a name="overview"></a>

Masterpiece is a cross platform mobile app for art enthusiasts, artists, gallerias and investors to explore, discover, purchase, and sell artworks. The app aims to bring together artists, galleries, investors, and art enthusiasts in a seamless and modern manner. The "killer app" of Masterpiece is our in-house ai model Patina; Patina is a fine-tuned online ResNet CNN for the purpose of generating the price of a painting based on training data. Patina is used to inform investors who are determining the value of an painting and to inform artists on the value of their painting. The model is retrained whenever a purchase is made, which keeps the model up to date, and, therefore, creates an efficient art market.

## :runner: Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>

In 2005, unbeknownst to the auctioneers, Leonardo Da Vinci's Salvator Mundi was presented at St. Charles Gallery, it was subsequently acquired for $1,175. Fast forward to 2017 and it was sold at Christie's for a staggering $450,312,500. Disparities like these often occur in the art industry partly because it is difficult to determine the value of a painting. Masterpiece is an attempt to bridge this gap.
